## Willkommen Null
"What is this – null?" my good friend Čazim asked me when I helped him to create his profile on the Austrian Labor Agency web site.

![Willkommen null on the Austrian Labor Agency (AMS) Web Site](/resources/null-is-a-mystical-guardian/willkommen-null-on-the-austrian-labor-agency-ams-web-site.jpg)

"It's a warm welcome and at the same time a sign that someone didn't do her/his job well." I told to him.

(Speaking of a warm welcome and not doing the job well, here is another one example. This time it wasn't null reaching the surface but Mr. !%firstName%!.)

## Hunted by Null
Explaining null to someone who just got his first computer is not an easy task. Here is [the best definition I found so far](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Null):

> Null is a mystical guardian who protects you when you enter new areas. He is a passive and benevolent force, and as such his combat level never rises above 1.

The honest [author of the above definition](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/RuneScape_Wiki) let null reach the surface of its game, giving us a unique opportunity to get to know it better. So let's take the opportunity and explore the mystical personality of null.

Null hunts you.

Null has its avatar. It's a dragon, of course.

After all this, how can anyone say that [null is evil]({% post_url 2013-05-15-option-idiom %})?
